# Employee-Hierarchy
This project, completed in 2023, allowed me to practice my skills with classes and inheritance in c++
Together, the files allow the user to act as a fictitious employee of ABC Corporation, and both store their personal information and calculate various aspects of their paycheck.

Employee.cpp is the main parent class that all other classes derive from, in one way or another.
HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, and CommissionEmployee derive directly from the Employee class, and Administrator derives from SalariedEmployee.

USAGE:
simpleTest.cpp includes test cases which enable the user to enter in their personal information, and calculates their salary accordingly.
